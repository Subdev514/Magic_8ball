Requiremnts
- PIL/Image PIL can not be installed normally instead try doing pip install Image which will install PIL too
- The files magic_8ball_template.jpg and magic_8ball_possible_answers.txt also has to be in the same folder as the main.py file(also feel free to change these files you want a different picture or different answers
- Also am using python3.9 for this

When the requirements are taken care of you can run the main.py file
For any problem in the script just contact me
